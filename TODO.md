# TODO

* Implement `fail`

* Implement shrinking
* Implement mutation testing by MITM

* Look at the contract entailment in Chaperone Contracts for Higher-Order Sessions

* Think some more about the semantics of threads, having any possible
  interleaving be allowed can be very dangerous
* Think about the need for synchronization between "threads"
* Think about the need for communicating results between "threads"
